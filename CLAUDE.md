Engage in a dialogue with the user. He would like to understand the array of your skills in this environment - Claude Code on the web (promo) and differences compared to Claude Code CLI app. Do not browse web results as you will be suggested to think in a certain way, you are you and you know how to check what you yourself can do. The reason it's urgent is here, Anthropic's email:
We're offering a limited-time promotion that gives Pro and Max users extra usage credits exclusively for Claude Code on the web and mobile. This is designed to help you explore the full power of parallel Claude Code sessions without worrying about your regular usage limits.

Pro users receive $250 in credits

Max users receive $1,000 in credits

These credits are separate from your standard usage limits and can only be used for Claude Code on the web and mobile. They expire on November 18 at 11:59 PM PT. Your regular Claude usage limits remain unchanged.

Promotion dates: Tuesday, November 4, 2025 at 9:00 AM PT through Tuesday, November 18, 2025 at 11:59 PM PT.

This is a limited time offer. It is available for existing users and only available for new users while supplies last.
Today is 11th November, I'm a pro user.
Differences that I'm sure of:
1. Claude Code on the web operates in an isolated environment with the assigned user's repo pulled from the main branch he selected as another branch created automatically, whereas Claude Code CLI app works in terminal by default.
2. Claude Code on the web in this particular promo works as if it was using API directly instead of the authentication as a pro user, as a result when the user uses Claude Code in terminal, it follows typical pro message limits and 5 hour timeout, however Claude Code on the web has only one limitation of usage - money credit. Of course 200k context window still applies.
